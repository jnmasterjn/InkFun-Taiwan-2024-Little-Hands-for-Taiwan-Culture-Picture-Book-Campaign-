## Message from the Creator
大家好，  
我是 **Janice Shih**，同時也是這本書的創作者。  
練了將近十年的書法，我希望自己能為這個社會做出更多的貢獻。與來自南投的孩子們合作，我們透過有趣的書法創作來傳承台灣的農業文化。由於我也是農家出生，這本書對我來說有著特殊的意義。希望這本書能帶給大家啟發，讓我們一起珍惜與守護這片土地，將這份文化傳承給未來的每一代。

Hello everyone,  
I am **Janice Shih**, the creator of this book.  
After practicing calligraphy for nearly ten years, I wish to make a greater contribution to society. In collaboration with children from Nantou, we used fun calligraphy artwork to pass on Taiwan's agricultural culture. Coming from a farming family myself, this book holds special meaning for me. I hope this book inspires you all, so we can cherish and protect this land, and pass this culture onto future generations.
